# Creating and Using a Python Virtual Environment

## What is a virtual environment (VENV)?

A virtual environment is a special folder on your computer where Python stores all the packages and settings just for your project. This keeps your projectâ€™s packages separate from other projects and from the main Python installation on your computer. Using a virtual environment helps avoid conflicts and makes your project easier to manage.

## How to create a virtual environment

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Go to the folder where your project is located.
3. Type the following command and press Enter:

   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

   This will create a new folder called `.venv` in your project directory.

## How to activate the virtual environment

- **Windows:**
  ```
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **macOS/Linux:**
  ```
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

After activation, you will see the name of the virtual environment (usually `.venv`) at the beginning of the command line. Now, any Python packages you install will only affect this project.

**Tip:** Remember to activate the virtual environment every time you start working on your project.
