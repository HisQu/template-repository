## Usage
[Include instructions how to use the repository, often it is as simple as running a `quick_setup.bat` or downloading the releases from the release page.]  

When using this repository, please remember:
- API keys must be managed securely → see [API Key Guidelines]([../UsingAPIKeys/](https://github.com/HisQu/.github-private/tree/main/coding-practices/UsingAPIKeys))  
- Sensitive configs should be placed in `.env` files → see [DotEnv Usage]([../DotEnv/](https://github.com/HisQu/.github-private/tree/main/coding-practices/DotEnv))  

## Installing Instructions

### Prerequesites
- [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) (e.g., from 3.10.1 upwards – see [Python version guide](https://devguide.python.org/versions/))  
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  
- Project-specific tools (list here, if needed)  

### Step by Step:
1. Clone this repository to your local device.  
   **Alternatively:** If you don't have Git installed, download the project as a .zip file and extract all data into a folder.
2. [Optional: If you have a `quick_setup.py` or `quicksetup.bat` file to do this for the user, list that here as an option]   
3. [Create and activate a virtual environment](https://github.com/HisQu/.github-private/tree/main/coding-practices/PythonVENV)) in your project folder.  
4. Initialize your submodules.  
5. [Install all required python packages]([../PythonRequirementsText/](https://github.com/HisQu/.github-private/tree/main/coding-practices/PythonRequirementsText)) using:  

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Set up your [``.env file``](https://github.com/HisQu/.github-private/tree/main/coding-practices/DotEnv) with the necessary Environmental Variables. Never commit .env files → always protect them with .gitignore
7. Add any other necessary steps for setup.

**Development**
- Follow the guidelines for Template Repositories when creating new projects.
- Always commit with an up-to-date [``requirements.txt``](https://github.com/HisQu/.github-private/tree/main/coding-practices/PythonRequirementsText).
- Protect secrets and credentials with [``.env``](https://github.com/HisQu/.github-private/tree/main/coding-practices/DotEnv) + [.gitignore](https://github.com/HisQu/.github-private/tree/main/coding-practices/GitIgnore).
